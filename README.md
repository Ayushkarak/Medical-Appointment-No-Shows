# 🏥 Predicting No-Shows in Medical Appointments

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes a real-world dataset of **110,000+ medical appointments** in Brazil to understand and address the **problem of patient no-shows**. Nearly 1 in 3 appointments are missed, leading to wasted hospital resources and delayed care.

The aim of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to uncover patterns and build actionable insights that can inform **AI-driven solutions** to improve appointment attendance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze key variables influencing no-shows (age, gender, chronic conditions, reminders, socioeconomic factors).
- Visualize patient behavior and health system inefficiencies.
- Recommend strategies for **data-driven intervention**, including predictive modeling and smarter communication.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Younger patients** and those receiving **scholarships** are more likely to miss appointments.
- **Chronic patients** (with hypertension/diabetes) are more likely to show up.
- **Longer waiting times** between scheduling and appointment date increase no-shows.
- **SMS reminders** have **limited impact** — highlighting the need for smarter strategies.
- Specific **neighborhoods** showed no-show rates >50%, suggesting location-based barriers.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Build a **predictive model** to flag high-risk no-show patients.
- Implement **personalized reminders** (WhatsApp, app push, calls).
- Reduce waiting periods and optimize scheduling (e.g., avoid Monday overloads).
- Launch targeted outreach in high-risk areas via community partnerships or mobile units.

## 🧠 Target Audience
This project is valuable for:
- **Health-tech product teams** building AI tools
- **Hospitals & clinics** facing resource inefficiencies
- **Data scientists** looking to work in healthcare AI
